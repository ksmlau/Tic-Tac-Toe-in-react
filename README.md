# Tic-Tac-Toe project in React
learning react through the Tic-Tac-Toe project provided by reactjs.org. This is a starter project used to learn the main concepts of react and a starter project by me.

In this game, you can play against another player. The game includes a turn tracker, which allows you to view past moves and see how the game progressed. To start a new game, simply select the number of players (1 or 2) and the game board will appear. Players can take turns placing their mark (X or O) on the board until a winner is declared or the game ends in a draw. The history tracker can be accessed by clicking on turn buttons that appear on the side. Enjoy!
